      <h4 className="p-3 h5 fw-bold">What is Front-End Development ?</h4>
      <p className="px-3 ">
        Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive
        elements of a website that users interact with directly. It's a
        combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides the
        structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic
        behaviour and interactivity. As a front-end developer, you'll be
        responsible for creating the user interface of a website, to ensure it
        looks good and is easy to use, with great focus on design principles and
        user experience. You'll be working closely with designers, back-end
        developers, and project managers to make sure the final product meets
        the client's needs and provides the best possible experience for the
        end-users.

      <h4 className="p-3 h5 fw-bold">How to become a Frontend Developer ?</h4>
      <p className="px-3">
        Start with learning HTML and CSS; don't wait to fully master these and
        start building simple projects as soon as possible. You could try
        rebuilding the frontend of your favorite websites using HTML and CSS to
        start with. Do as many of these projects as possible as you keep
        learning. Once you are somewhat comfortable with HTML and CSS, start
        learning some basic JavaScript (DOM manipulation, making AJAX calls etc)
        and learn how to add interactivity to your websites. While you are at it
        learn some basics of Git and GitHub. At this point you should be able to
        get an entry level frontend development job. Keep revisiting this
        roadmap and try to fill the gaps in your knowledge.
